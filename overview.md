**Quickstarts > Quick Start Guide**

The NHN Cloud Quick Start Guide is a step-by-step onboarding guide for users who are new to NHN Cloud.  With this guide, you can quickly learn how to use the NHN Cloud Console, a unified management tool that enables you to efficiently manage and set up various cloud resources, and start providing cloud services. 

This guide is organized into 12 learning modules as shown below, each of which provides hands-on examples for easy follow along. After signing up as an NHN Cloud member, you will learn how to use the basic console and eventually be able to configure a simple cloud architecture to provide services.

## Configuring the Quick Start Guide

Each learning module in the NHN Cloud Quick Start Guide is organized into three main areas. 

1. **Learning objective**: A brief overview of what you'll learn in the learning module.
2. **Before You Begin**: Shows you what you need to do to prepare for a smooth learning module.
3. **Lab assignments**: These cover the work you'll do in the learning module and are broken down into steps.
4. **Resources**: You can find more in-depth information related to that learning module.

!!! tip "Tips"
    Each learning module is linked to the others. Because resources created in one learning module are reused in subsequent learning modules, we recommend that you do not delete resources until you have finished the last learning module.
